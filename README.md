# 📊 Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the **Netflix dataset** to uncover trends in content distribution, genres, ratings and growth patterns over time.  
The dataset contains details such as title, type (Movie/TV Show), director, country, release year, date added, rating, duration and genres.  

Through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, the project provides insights into Netflix’s content strategy, global reach and viewer preferences.  


## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of **Movies vs. TV Shows** on Netflix.  
- Track the **growth of Netflix content over the years**.  
- Identify the **most common genres** and their popularity.  
- Explore **regional content production trends** (top contributing countries).  
- Study **rating distribution** to understand Netflix’s target audience.  
- Examine **movie runtimes** and **TV show season counts**.  
- Discover the **oldest and newest titles** on the platform.  


## 🔎 Key Insights
- **Movies dominate** Netflix’s library (70%), while TV shows form 30%.  
- **USA, India, and UK** lead in content production.  
- A major spike in content occurred **post-2015**, reflecting Netflix’s global expansion.  
- The most common rating is **TV-MA**, highlighting a focus on adult audiences.  
- **International Movies and Dramas** are the top genres.  
- Most movies are **90–120 minutes long**, while most TV shows have only **1–2 seasons**.  


## 📂 Project Structure
- `netflix.csv` – Dataset  
- `Netflix-EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full code  
- `Netflix-EDA.pdf` – Exported report with code, visualizations & insights  
- `images/` – Saved plots (content distribution, growth, genres, ratings, etc.)  


## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** (pandas,  matplotlib, seaborn, wordcloud)
- **Jupyter Notebook**


## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**
   git clone https://github.com/kanupriya-rawat/Netflix-EDA.git
   cd Netflix-EDA
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook and run cells
4. To view results without running code, open the PDF report (Netflix-EDA.pdf).


## 🚀 Results
This analysis reveals **Netflix’s focus on international expansion, drama-heavy content, and mature audiences**.  
It provides a structured understanding of how Netflix curates its library to attract and retain subscribers globally.  


## ⚠️ Limitations
- Dataset is **static** and may not reflect Netflix’s most recent catalog updates.  
- Some entries have **missing values** (e.g., directors, countries, duration), which might bias results.    
- Analysis is **exploratory and descriptive only**, without predictive modeling.  
- Dataset does not include **viewer engagement metrics** (watch hours, user ratings, popularity).  


## 🔮 Future Work
- Use **machine learning models** to predict content type (Movie vs. TV Show).  
- Build a **time-series forecast** of Netflix’s growth by genre or country.  
- Develop a **recommendation system prototype** using genres, ratings, and durations.    
- Deploy results in a **Streamlit/Dash web app** for public use.
